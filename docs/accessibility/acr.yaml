notes: "This report describes the core components of App Suite's web user interface: Login, Mail, Portal, Address Book, Chat, Calendar, Tasks, Drive and Settings. Documents and any user content (e.g. HTML mails) is not covered by this report, as we cannot modify user content. App Suite is available as a wide-label application, and supports customer customizations and plugins that can alter appearance, content and functionality; these customizations and plugins are not covered by this document. App Suite supports a range of end-user configurable themes and accent colors, however, this document only covers the default theme and accent color, unless stated otherwise. We use the term 'App Suite UI' to describe the parts of App Suite that are covered by this report, with the aforementioned exceptions."
