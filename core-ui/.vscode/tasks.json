/* This tasks.json can be used to start often recurring tasks.
 *
 *  'Start DevServer' runs `yarn dev` in the VS Code terminal.
 *  The output is not presented to the user to prevent distractions but can be seen by opening the corresponding terminal.
 *  To start the dev server on start, uncomment the 'runOptions' block.
 *
 *  To prevent local changes from merging it is advised to add tasks.json to the global gitignore (~/.gitignore_global).
