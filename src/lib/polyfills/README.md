# Polyfills

## Text Encode Transformations

**File:** text-encode-transform.js

**Origin:** <https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/text-encode-transform-polyfill>

This is a polyfill for the transform streams TextEncoderStream and TextDecoderStream. It is based on the TextEncoderStream and TextDecoderStream interfaces from the Encoding Standard: https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-textdecoderstream

**Removal condition:** This can be removed, when Firefox ESR has moved past version 105.
